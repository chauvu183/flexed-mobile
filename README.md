# Was ist FlexEd?

FlexEd (f√ºr **flex**ible **ed**ucation) is an evaluation tool for teachers who supervise classes with self-organized learning. Adapted from a pilot project at a school in Schleswig-Holstein, teachers can manage classes, assign tasks, and track and evaluate student progress. FlexEd eliminates tedious paperwork and helps groups of teachers coordinate their work.
