# What is FlexEd?

FlexEd (f√ºr **flex**ible **ed**ucation) is an evaluation tool for teachers who supervise classes with self-organized learning. Adapted from a pilot project at a school in Schleswig-Holstein, teachers can manage classes, assign tasks, and track and evaluate student progress. FlexEd eliminates tedious paperwork and helps groups of teachers coordinate their work.

"Flexklassen" are a special class form at the Grund- und Gemeinschaftsschule Schwarzenbek. In this class, students with increased support needs who are willing to learn come together. Participation is to be seen as a privilege and in case of conspicuous, disruptive behavior, one is expelled from the class. In order to implement this form of class structure, increased administrative effort is required. FlexEd comes into play to support teachers in this process.
  
  
### Self-organized learning
FlexEd was modeled on a pilot project at a school in Schleswig-Holstein and follows the following concept:
- The teacher takes attendance at the beginning of a self-organized teaching unit.
- The students indicate the subject area (German, math, etc.) they would like to work on in the teaching unit.
- The students now work **independently** on tasks from the subject area under their own responsibility - there is no frontal teaching.
- At the end of the lesson, the teacher asks each student how they did and how long it took them to complete the tasks.
  
### How does FlexEd help?
FlexEd supports the teacher:
- The teacher can record and organize assignments in FlexEd
- Attendance and the subject area worked on is recorded directly in FlexEd
- The student's feedback is stored directly on the tasks and can thus be used for evaluations
- The progress of the students can be evaluated in FlexEd

### What the FlexEd web application offers: 
- Convenient class and student management
- Administration of subjects
- Create and manage differentiated and cross-subject assignments
- Attach worksheets and materials to tasks
- Assemble workstations from the task pool
- Tracking of the students' learning progress related to the work status in the stations
- Manage a to-do list for the team of teachers
